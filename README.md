# mailbox

A typed safe plugin for [omegga](https://github.com/brickadia-community/omegga).\
Based off the old plugin by [voximity](https://github.com/voximity), [omegga-mail](https://github.com/voximity/omegga-mail).\
This plugin uses a regex pattern from the old plugin, so thank you vox for that.

## Install

`omegga install gh:astrrsk/mailbox`

## Usage

_TODO: make a nice looking useage section  lol_
